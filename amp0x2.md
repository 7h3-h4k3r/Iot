# Conductors and Non-Conductors (Insulators)

Conductors and Non-Conductors (also called Insulators) are materials that differ in their ability to allow electricity to flow through them.

## 🧠 Conductors:
- **Definition**: Materials that allow the flow of electricity because their atoms have free electrons that can move easily.
  
- **How they work**: In conductors, the outermost electrons of atoms are loosely bound and can easily move from one atom to another when a voltage is applied, allowing the flow of current.

- **Example**: Metals like copper, aluminum, gold, etc.

- **Why**: Metal atoms are arranged in a way that allows their outer electrons to move freely, making them good at conducting electricity.

## 🧠 Non-Conductors (Insulators):
- **Definition**: Materials that do not allow electricity to flow easily because their atoms have tightly bound electrons that cannot move freely.

- **How they work**: In insulators, the electrons are tightly bound to their atoms, and as a result, current cannot easily flow through them.

- **Example**: Wood, rubber, plastic, glass.

- **Why**: The atoms in these materials are packed tightly together, making it difficult for electrons to move between atoms.

## ⚡ Summary:
- **Conductors** = Free electrons = Good for conducting electricity (e.g., metals).
- **Non-Conductors (Insulators)** = Tightly bound electrons = Poor at conducting electricity (e.g., wood, rubber).

**Conductors (Metals):**
```
      Free Electrons
     ↓         ↓        ↓
   ●--●--●--●--●--●--●--●
  (Atom1)(Atom2)(Atom3)(Atom4)
         (Loose Electrons move freely)
```

**Non-Conductors (Wood/Plastic):**
```
      Tightly Bound Electrons
   ●--●--●--●--●--●--●--●
  (Atom1)(Atom2)(Atom3)(Atom4)
       (Electrons are tightly bound and can't move easily)
```

### 🔑 **Key Differences**:
- **Conductors**: Electrons can move freely between atoms.
- **Non-Conductors**: Electrons are tightly held, restricting movement.
