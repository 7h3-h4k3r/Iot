# Atom Structure Overview

An atom consists of a nucleus at the center, which contains protons and neutrons. Electrons revolve around the nucleus in defined energy levels or orbits.

## 🧠 Quick Breakdown:
- **Proton**: Positively charged particle in the nucleus.
- **Neutron**: Neutral particle (no charge) in the nucleus.
- **Electron**: Negatively charged particle that orbits the nucleus.

## ⚛️ Atom Structure Diagram (Text Format):
```yaml
           Electron (-)
              ●
              |
              |   Nucleus
     ●--------●--------●
              |
              ●
           Electron (-)

Nucleus = Protons (+) + Neutrons (0)
Electrons = Orbiting the nucleus
